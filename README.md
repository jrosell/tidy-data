### A few definitions
- Variable: A measurement or an attribute. Height, weight, sex, etc.
- Value: The actual measurement or attribute. 152 cm, 80 kg, female, etc.
- Observation: All values measure on the same unit. Each person.

### Defining tidy data
The structure Wickham defines as tidy has the following attributes:
- Each variable forms a column and contains values
- Each observation forms a row
- Each type of observational unit forms a table
